# Google Play Store Apps Analysis (EDA) 📊  

## Overview  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Google Play Store Apps dataset** (sourced from Kaggle) to uncover market trends, app performance metrics, and pricing strategies. The dataset contains **10,000+ app records**, and the analysis focuses on **ratings, reviews, installs, and pricing models**.  

## Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling **missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies** for better data integrity.  
- Perform **statistical analysis** using **Pandas** and **NumPy** to extract meaningful insights.  
- Create **data visualizations** with **Matplotlib** to represent trends in app ratings, reviews, installs, and pricing models.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Tools & Libraries:** Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Dataset:** Google Play Store Apps (Kaggle)  

## Key Findings  
- Identified trends in **popular app categories**, pricing models, and rating distributions.  
- Examined the relationship between **app reviews, installs, and average ratings**.  
- Visualized key insights to understand **what makes an app successful** on the Play Store.
